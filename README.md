# ascii.live-termux fork from github.com/hugomd/parrot.live

A fork project for hosting curl-based animations, all in one place, and a follow up to [`parrot.live`](https://github.com/hugomd/parrot.live).

Any animations you want to add are welcome! ðŸŽ‰

Try it out in your TERMUX:
```bash
. <(curl -L https://luisadha.github.io/ascii-live-termux)
```
You're in luck if you get a "nyan" endpoint.
